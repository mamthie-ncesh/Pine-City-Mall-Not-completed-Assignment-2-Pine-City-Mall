           <h1>SHOPPING IS THERAPUTIC!</h1>
<p>tail therapy is shopping with the primary purpose of improving the buyer's mood or disposition. Often seen in people during periods of depression or stress, it is normally a short-lived habit. Items purchased during periods of retail therapy are sometimes referred to as "comfort buys" (compare comfort CLOTHING)<BR>With a new season in full swing, it’s easy to feel like you literally don’t have anything to wear — even if you have a full closet of clothing right in front of you! It’s always tempting to just buy something new if you’ve been wearing the same pieces on repeat and can’t think of any other new ways to style them.

    But I have good news for you: getting out of a fashion rut is easier than you think and can save you money in the long run. Because as much as I love shopping, sometimes it’s smart to evaluate what you already have before committing to something new. That way, everything in your closet is worn and loved, rather than stuffed into a corner, away from the light of day!</BR></p>
